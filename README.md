# Gstore

##Code for submission to kaggle.com Gstore competition (Winter 2018-2019). 

File summaries:

gstore_csv_creation.R shows the code that turns the raw data provdied by kaggle (test.csv) into a .csv that can be analysed. 

gstoreCV.R has code with the cross validation format I chose to use. 

Gstore_final_submissions.R creates the final Elastic Net model submitted to kaggle on all data in the test.csv.

Files should be reproducable after downloading the raw data from kaggle.
